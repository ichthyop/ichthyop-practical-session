# Getting started

## Install Java

Ichthyop is a Java program. Therefore, Java is required.

```
java -version
```

::: callout-warning
**Java \> 11 is required!**
:::

## Install NetCDF {.smaller}

Ichthyop also need the NetCDF-C library to run.

**Linux**

## Expected results

You should see larval dispersal off Cape Town in South Africa (@fig-conf1).

# New simulations

## Exploring configuration file

-   Explore the different processes and parameters contained in the configuration file and their default values (@fig-edit)

![Exploring configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ichthyop/ichthyop/master/doc/console/_static/edit.png){#fig-edit fig-align="center" height="500"}

## Deactivating advection

-   In the configuration file, go to:

```{mermaid}
   flowchart LR
   id1(Advanced)
   id2(Transport)
   id3(Advection)
   id1 --> id2
   id2 --> id3
```

-   Disable advection by clicking on the `Enabled` tick box

-   Save the configuration file by clicking the `Save` button.

::: {.callout-warning}
**Remember to save it after every change**
:::

- Run the simulation
- Draw map
- **What happens?**

## Playing with advection/diffusion

- Repeat the operations above by activating only diffusion
- Repeat the operations above by activating both advection/diffusion

Results of the different Ichthyop configurations

:::

## Vertical migration

- In the `Mapping` section,  choose to represent the `depth`
variable, with values -50, -30 and -10 m for min., med. and max., respectively.
- Click on `Make maps`

- In the configuration file, go to:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
id1(Advanced)
id2(Transport)
id3(Vertical migration)
id1 --> id2
id2 --> id3
```

- Read the
explanations at
the top of the block. Click on `Enabled` and look at the default values of the parameters.

## Vertical migration

- Run the simulation with larval vertical migration. Note that the depth of larvae is now changing
according to the vertical scheme specified, but that this movement has almost no effect on the
overall larval distribution (@fig-mig2).

- Change the vertical migration scheme such that larvae stay at -50 m depth day and night. Note that
there is now a (small) effect (@fig-mig3)

- Go back to the initial situation by unselecting vertical migration

## Growth

- Go to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
id1(Advanced)
id2(Biology)
id3(Growth)
id1 --> id2
id2 --> id3
```

- Read the explanations at the top of the block and activate growth
- Run the simulation and visualise the `length` variable using `Auto range` for the values and colours
- Go to:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
id1(Advanced)
id2(Biology)
id3(Early-life stages)
id1 --> id2
id2 --> id3
```

- Read the explanations at the top of the block.
- Visualise the `stage` variable using `Auto range` for the values and colours.

## Initial positions in a text file

Unselect vertical migration and growth. Go to Advanced - Release - Drifters from text file.

Select, click on the `Edit` button inside the `Value` field and create the file proposed by
default (`benguela_drifters.txt`); it contains the initial positions of all individuals. Run the
simulation and observe the individuals locations.

Open the plot_traj_Ichthyop_v3_TP function in the R software. Try to understand the code.
Go to Main - Time and Main - Output in Ichthyop to understand why the value of lasttime is
61 in the R function. Adjust the path to the last file (ncdf format, .nc) created by Ichthyop in
the `ichthyop-3.2b\output` directory of your computer. Install the R packages ncdf and maps if
necessary, then execute the function (Figure 3). Make the necessary changes in the R function
to plot only the last positions of individuals and check that they are the same as those plotted
in the graphic interface of Ichthyop.
